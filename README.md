**Lecture 2: Universal Human Values
Speaker: Priya Ma’am**

Core Theme:
Understanding and aligning one’s life with the Basic Aspiration — continuous happiness and prosperity — rather than chasing disconnected short-term goals.

Activity Reflection:
Participants reviewed personal aspirations (चाहना) and concerns (चिंता). A common pattern emerged:

Aspirations:

Academic excellence
Good job with high salary
Family pride and personal happiness
Concerns:

Peer pressure
Lack of confidence
Time constraints
Stage fear
Lack of discipline
The "Why?" Chain of Reflection:
What are you doing? → e.g., Studying hard
Why? → To become an engineer
Why? → To earn money and respect
Why? → To be happy and prosperous
This reflective chain led to the realization that:

All efforts ultimately aim at achieving lasting happiness and prosperity.

Life Planning Approaches:
Linear (1 → 2 → 3 → 4): Acting without deeper clarity of purpose
Reverse (4 → 3 → 2 → 1): Starting with clarity of aspiration, then planning steps
The reverse approach was emphasized as more effective and resilient during setbacks (e.g., failing to get into a dream college or not getting a preferred roommate).

Key Takeaways:
Understand your Basic Aspiration clearly
View career and academic achievements as means, not the end
If one path fails, find another without losing purpose
Reflect on past disappointments to evaluate your reaction and growth
Assignment:
Reflect on whether continuous happiness and prosperity is your true aspiration
Recall a moment when a desired path closed and analyze your response
